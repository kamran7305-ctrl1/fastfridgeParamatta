# Page progress

**Update this file after every page. At the start of each session: read this file, find the first TO DO page in the build order below, tell the user "Today's page: X (URL, primary keyword)" in 1 line, and build it.** The user must not have to say which page is next.

Standing rules: `claude/content-standard.md` and `claude/website-context.md`. Keyword data: `claude/keyword-strategy.md`. Flat URLs only. Never invent reviews, stats, phone or ARCtick numbers.

## Log
- 14 Oct 2026: /fridge-regas built.
- 15 Oct 2026: /samsung-fridge-repair-parramatta and /lg-fridge-repair built from user-supplied HTML.
- 16 Oct 2026: keyword sheet saved to claude/. Built COMM-FRIDGE (/commercial-refrigeration-repair). Competitor sites could not be fetched (network block), used sheet benchmarks only. Linked from header/footer "Commercial Fridge Repair", services, cost, emergency pages. Spoke links (coolroom, freezer, ice) are plain text until those pages exist: when each spoke is built, link it from COMM-FRIDGE (equipment cards, FAQ 8) and the footer.
- 16 Oct 2026: Built COOLROOM (/coolroom-repair). Owner confirmed the page did not exist on the live site. Coolroom installation NOT claimed (unconfirmed). Linked from header/footer, services, cost, emergency, and the COMM-FRIDGE hub.
- RULE: before building any page, check the live site if the network allows (sandbox could not reach fridgerepairparramatta.com.au on 16 Oct); otherwise ask the owner to confirm the page does not already exist.
- 16 Oct 2026: Built COMM-FREEZER (/commercial-freezer-repair). Owner confirmed it did not exist live. Linked from COMM-FRIDGE hub (upright card) and COOLROOM related list.
- BRANCHES: all new work goes on `claude/new-pages-seo-oct16` (PR #8 to main). Do NOT push to `claude/site-layout-review-knuu9t` (PR #7, owner wants it left alone).
- 19 Oct 2026: Built ICE (/ice-machine-repair) on branch `claude/ice-machine-page` (owner confirmed 404 on live site). Linked from COMM-FRIDGE hub, footer/header "Ice Machine Repair" and services card. PR #8 and #9 are merged; `claude/new-pages-seo-oct16` is finished, use a fresh branch from `main` per page.
- Next: SEAL (/fridge-door-seal-replacement).
